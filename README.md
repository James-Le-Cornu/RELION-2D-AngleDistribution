# RELION-2D-AngleDistribution
This Python script generates a 2D angular distribution heatmap from a RELION run_data.star file. It visualizes the distribution of particle orientations in terms of azimuth and elevation, providing a quick way to assess angular coverage in cryo-EM datasets (similar to cryoSPARC).
